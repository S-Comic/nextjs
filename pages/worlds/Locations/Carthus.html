     <h1>Carthus</h1>

    <p>Carthus is a continent that is almost entirely made up of a desert of
      black ash. The&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../Groups/Kings%20of%20Sereni.html"

      claim to this land, and while their legitimacy can be questioned their
      power cannot.</p>
    <p><i>“One day, an mysterious force appeared, it infected everything from the tallest sky city to the deepest tunnel system. As it did so it warped and contaminated every living thing it touched. Vibrant forests began to twist and turn, trees that turn deep purple and sickly green. But worst of all were the monsters, any beast or monster that had existed was infected with this blight, it transformed these things into manifestations of their desires, fears and other such instincts. Not even man, and the other races that held civilisations were exempt from this, these two were warped with many turning into all kinds of monstrosities. Most of civilization was lost, damned to this infection. And so the paladins of Soliera stepped in, they purged the land of corruption through fire and light, burning away the land, the sky and everyone within it (the desolation event) creating what is now known as Carthus, the fields of ash. Whilst Carthus is nothing close to an ideal environment for life, the people there are free from corruption, and the tattered remains of the non corrupted paladins act as eternal sentries to protect from corruption.”</i>

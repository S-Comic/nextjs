     <h1>Seko Shura</h1>

    <p><strong>The following is from the notes of</strong>&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
      href="../../Player%20Characters/Thomas%20Vic.html" data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/oJtUGkUcN0zI/G2hKu0ouYaCj">Thomas Vic</a>:</p>
    <p>"Our intrepid heroes first encountered the great Seko Shura unbeknownst
      to them outside the gates of <a href="../../Locations/Carthus/Navlaan">Navlaan</a>.
      He appeared as a homeless, one armed wanderer. Before their disagreement
      over the place of violence Shura even tutored Thomas after he survived
      execution at the hands of the <a href="../../Groups/Paladins%20of%20Soliera.html">paladins</a>.
      Since then Seko was last seen as an escort to&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
      href="Devi.html" data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/2f6ufPCBm1JE/oUxuiuLpMrCg/YQDVx2dR2PFp">Devi</a>&nbsp;his
      adopted niece, and trained <a href="../../Groups/Blood%20Orcs/Tharin.html">Tharin</a> in
      his Mountain Splitting technique.</p>
    <p>In the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../Locations/Carthus/Kolasi%20Archive.html"
      data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/ARlFLAkgDcEH/Dwk9jHUXQvaE/eVDZAdMlU5g0">Kolasi Archive</a>&nbsp;Seko’s
      legend was uncovered: Seko killed the Gods by walking to the tallest mountain
      in <a href="../../Locations/Carthus/Redrock.html">Red Rock</a> and cut in
      half to issue a challenge to them all. All the Gods, 1000 Gods, attacked
      at once. They all died in ten days, when Solaria and Tummora arrived. They
      wounded one another and called a stalemate. Seko blinded Tammora and blinded
      and ripped off Solaria's ears and she cut off his hand. Solaria wielded
      corruption in the battle.</p>
    <p>When Thomas climbed the Black Mountain and met the <a href="../Patrons/Shadow%20Queen.html">Shadow Queen</a>’s
      chief lieutenant <a href="../Patrons/Defiance.html">Defiance</a>, she alluded
      to the fact that Seko too had once climbed the same mountain. Thomas received
      a gift from Defiance but it is unclear what Seko received other than the
      disapproval of Defiance after he split her mountain."

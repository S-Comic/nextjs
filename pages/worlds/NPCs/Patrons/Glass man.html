    <p>The glass man is a being, perhaps an old god, who is the patron of&nbsp;

      data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/oJtUGkUcN0zI/DrnJJ8qelLsB">Juno Whitfoot</a>. According to&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../Carthian/Seko%20Shura.html"

        he's also able to shape-shift and isn't a person that should be easily
        trusted. Little else is known about this figure, although he almost certainly
        has ill intentions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Throughout the game the glass man has entrusted Juno with a variety of
      boons, including the ability to teleport short distances, limited spell-casting,
      and an orb which can transform into any instrument. He appears to reside
      in a dimension made up entirely of glass shards, which Juno is able to
      visit at will by using his ‘Gift of the void’ on any doorway.&nbsp;</p>

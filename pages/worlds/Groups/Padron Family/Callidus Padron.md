# Callidus Padron
Callidus Padron is the current head of the [Padron crime family](../Padron%20Family.md) at a particularly young age. 

Callidus was the person who informed the party that [Katherine](../../NPCs/Carthian/Katherine.md) was indeed being kept in the basement of the Padron family household during the [Fancy Funeral Fuckery](../../Events/Fancy%20Funeral%20Fuckery.md) and led them down to it. However, this gesture was ultimately a trap to get the party arrested.

**The following is from the notes of** [Thomas Vic](../../Player%20Characters/Thomas%20Vic.md):

He had a brief conversation with_ [_Thomas_](../../Player%20Characters/Thomas%20Vic.md) _when revealed_ [_Katherine_](../../NPCs/Carthian/Katherine.md) _was being kept in his basement. After returning from the basement Callidus had called the_ [_King’s men_](../Knights%20of%20the%20four%20kings.md) _and had the party arrested for breaking and entering.”_

But, at least it could be argued that kid might have had a reason to do so, his elderly mother could have been dying of the cold or maybe the copper made from selling the rag would have bought food for the day. I'll never know the reason and it's harmful to speculate, everybody needs a little warmth sometimes, but my point is that you're able to speculate about his motivation at all._

_Callidus would rip that sheet away from a hobo because it's an object that the fucker doesn't yet own, and from what I've seen he wont be content until he owns everything and everyone. I suppose that's what you get when so much power goes to the head of a rich bloke._

_I wonder about that kid quite a bit nowadays. I hope people think about me the same way I do him, we al

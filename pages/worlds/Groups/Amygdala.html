     <h1>Amygdala</h1>

    <p>“<i>Bloodhunters are hunters of corruption, and in their fight against it they resort to all manner of strange and disturbing practices to warp one's body, soul and mind. Most bloodhunters don’t work as an organisation but instead work individually or in small groups. Often a child will be taken by a bloodhunter to be trained and then taken through the rituals, this means that there is great variation with how a bloodhunter fights, what kind of magic they use and what rituals they undergo. Whilst bloodhunters resist the corruption they are not immune to the effects and more recently have been corrupted blood hunters, who maintain the practice of taking an apprentice but whose goals are self-centred or for the sake of the corruption instead of against it. And the methods and rituals often infect the individual with the corruption to amplify strength</i>

    <p><i>Additionally there is one organisation of bloodhunters known as Amygdala. This organisation operates both within and outside of Carthus with the goal of venturing into the corrupted lands and destroying the corruption for good. Their leader, Ludwig, is revered as a god by some townsfolk that rest on the border of the corrupted lands for his power and constant protection though anyone in Amygdala sees him as the leader and as the perfect bloodhunter that all should aim to become."</i>

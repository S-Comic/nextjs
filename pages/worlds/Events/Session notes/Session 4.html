     <h1>Session 4</h1>

    <p>The session begins with&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../Player%20Characters/Morradrith.html"
      data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/oJtUGkUcN0zI/w37r8Z5pjv35">Morradrith</a>&nbsp;being
      captured by the paladin guards under suspicion of aiding a fugitive and
      he's taken to be interrogated. <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Juno%20Whitfoot.html">Juno</a> manages
      to avoid this by simply running away.&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../NPCs/Carthian/Katherine.html"
      data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/2f6ufPCBm1JE/oUxuiuLpMrCg/Ey6sGOe4zQiT">Katherine</a>&nbsp;also
      escapes and hides in an empty building which is owned by her out-of-town
      friend.</p>
    <p>The party re-convenes at the center of the town to discuss a way to break&nbsp;
      <a
      class="reference-link" href="../../Player%20Characters/Morradrith.html"
      data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/oJtUGkUcN0zI/w37r8Z5pjv35">Morradrith</a>&nbsp;out of ‘paladin jail’. To make sure that no-one is
        listening, <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Emmy%20Crystalridge.html">Emmy</a> casts
        detect magic and discovers that invisible feral goblins are listening in
        on the conversation. (We were very confused, and that's not how the spell
        works, but it's what happened). The party ignores the beasts for now, but
        we make sure they can't hear too much of our plans.</p>
    <p>Half of the party decide to go and check on&nbsp;<a class="reference-link"
      href="../../NPCs/Carthian/Katherine.html" data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/2f6ufPCBm1JE/oUxuiuLpMrCg/Ey6sGOe4zQiT">Katherine</a>&nbsp;to
      make sure she hasn't been found but they run into another invisible goblin
      on the way which they decide to capture. While the party is talking, Morradrith
      is questioned and let go.</p>
    <p>Sidenote, Emmy does some bullshit this session which I don't quite understand
      but it means she is able to get the casino coin.</p>

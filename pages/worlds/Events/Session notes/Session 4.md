# Session 4
The session begins with [Morradrith](../../Player%20Characters/Morradrith.md) being captured by the paladin guards under suspicion of aiding a fugitive and he's taken to be interrogated. [Juno](../../Player%20Characters/Juno%20Whitfoot.md) manages to avoid this by simply running away. [Katherine](../../NPCs/Carthian/Katherine.md) also escapes and hides in an empty building which is owned by her out-of-town friend.

The party re-convenes at the center of the town to discuss a way to break [Morradrith](../../Player%20Characters/Morradrith.md) out of ‘paladin jail’. To make sure that no-one is listening, [Emmy](../../Player%20Characters/Emmy%20Crystalridge.md) casts detect magic and discovers that invisible feral goblins are listening in on the conversation. (We were very confused, and that's not how the spell works, but it's what happened). The party ignores the beasts for now, but we make sure they can't hear too much of our plans.

Half of the party decide to go and check on [Katherine](../../NPCs/Carthian/Katherine.md) to make sure she hasn't been found but they run into another invisible goblin on the way which they decide to capture. While the party is talking, Morradrith is questioned and let go.

Sidenote, Emmy does some bullshit this session which I don't quite understand but it means she is able to get the

     <h1>Session 3</h1>

    <p>The <a href="../../Groups/Paladins%20of%20Soliera.html">paladins</a> ask
      us to find someone in the city who's been causing trouble named ‘Katherine’,
      although their reasons for asking are suspicious. Regardless, we agree
      to find this person and scour the city for them.</p>
    <p>It turns out that&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../NPCs/Carthian/Katherine.html"
      data-note-path="root/xPArRVtraNrO/2f6ufPCBm1JE/oUxuiuLpMrCg/Ey6sGOe4zQiT">Katherine</a>&nbsp;is
      a school teacher who's been espousing anti-paladin values, and it's likely
      that the paladins wish to execute her. We decide that we can't let that
      happen and that she has a right to free speech, and so we tell her that
      she has to hide somewhere in the city, which she does.</p>
    <p>While helping her escape,&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../../Player%20Characters/Juno%20Whitfoot.html"

        the session ends.</p>

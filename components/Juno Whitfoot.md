**The following is from the notes of** [Thomas Vic](Thomas%20Vic.md):

"_Juno is the nice guy of our Intrepid heroes, which is concerning because he’s a rogue. Juno is one of the original party members who met the party in_ [_Navlaan_](../Locations/Carthus/Navlaan) _after stealing a weapon from a_ [_Four King_](../Groups/Knights%20of%20the%20four%20kings.md)_’s barracks. Since then Juno has been a wanted man._

_Juno earned the title “Giantslayer” during his time serving in the strike force sent to assassinate_ [_Varanoth_](../NPCs/Hestian/Varanoth.md) _outside Navlaan. Before the attack was planned the party visited Varanoth’s tower to ask Varanoth to resurrect_ [_Cooper_](Cooper%20Brasskin.md) _who had been slain in a battle in Navlaan with invisible scouts. During his stay, Juno and_ [_Emmeline_](Emmy%20Crystalridge.md) _took part in a fighting pit and although Juno himself disputes the story (Juno and only Juno, everyone else agrees what happened), it was here Juno slew a giant in single combat. Since then his legend as the Giantslayer has been slowly growing throughout_ [_Carthus_](../Locations/Carthus.md)_._

_This however, was not the highlight of Juno’s stay as it was during this battle that Juno met the love of his life. A suited and booted tiefling, known simply as “_[_The Announcer_](../NPCs/Carthian/The%20Announcer.md)_” who travels the world setting up fights such as these. Juno and the Announcer’s love story had only just begun in Navlaan but after also encountering him in_ [_Gromack_](../Locations/Carthus/Gromack.md)_, a few in the party suspect that Juno only travels with our heroes to have another shot at meeting the Announcer._

_Like many in the party, Juno’s magnetic personality has attracted the patronage of a power being. Junos is a finely dressed_ [_man made of glass_](../NPCs/Patrons/Glass%20man.md) _who acts as a Fence for Juno and his “reacquired goods._"
